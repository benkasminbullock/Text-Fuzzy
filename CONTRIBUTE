How to contribute

As a first step please use the "issues" on github to file an issue
about what you want to do. The module's build process is very, very
convoluted, including two preprocessing steps to build the C files
from the source codes. Some of the tools for this preprocessing are
not publicly available. I can try to reduce the amount of complexity
to make it easier for other people to contribute, if you have some
idea of what you want to achieve, so open the issue first before doing
any work.

If you're looking for some small job to do, useful small jobs would
include adding tests of various features of the module, checking the
documentation for correctness, adding an example to the "examples"
directory, etc., but please don't reformat the source code or remove
comments.
