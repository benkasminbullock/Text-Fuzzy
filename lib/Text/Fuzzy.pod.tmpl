=head1 NAME

Text::Fuzzy - partial or fuzzy string matching using edit distances

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Text::Fuzzy;
    my $tf = Text::Fuzzy->new ('boboon');
    print "Distance is ", $tf->distance ('babboon'), "\n";
    # Prints "Distance is 2"
    my @words = qw/the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog/;
    my $nearest = $tf->nearest (\@words);
    print "Nearest array entry is ", $words[$nearest], "\n";
    # Prints "Nearest array entry is brown"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module calculates the Levenshtein edit distance between words,
and does edit-distance-based searching of arrays and files to find the
nearest entry. It can handle either byte strings or character strings
(strings containing Unicode), treating each Unicode character as a
single entity.

It is designed for high performance in searching for the nearest to a
particular search term over an array of words or a file, by reducing
the number of calculations which needs to be performed.

It supports either bytewise edit distances or Unicode-based edit distances:

    use utf8;
    my $tf = Text::Fuzzy->new ('あいうえお☺');
    print $tf->distance ('うえお☺'), "\n";
    # prints "2".

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    my $tf = Text::Fuzzy->new ('bibbety bobbety boo');

Create a new Text::Fuzzy object from the supplied word.

=head2 distance

    my $dist = $tf->distance ($word);

Return the edit distance to C<$word> from the word used to create the
object in L</new>.

=head2 nearest

    my $index = $tf->nearest (\@words);

Return the index of the nearest element in the array to the argument.

=head2 get_max_distance

    # Get the maximum edit distance.
    print "The max distance is ", $tf->getmax_distance (), "\n";

Get the maximum edit distance of C<$tf>. The default is set to 10.

=head2 set_max_distance

    # Set the max distance.
    $tf->set_max_distance (3);

Set the maximum edit distance of C<$tf>. The default is set to 10. If
this is called with an undefined value, the maximum edit distance is
switched off.

=head2 scan_file

    $tf->scan_file ('/usr/share/dict/words');

Scan a file to find the nearest match to the word used in
L</new>. This assumes that the file contains lines of text separated
by newlines and finds the closest match in the file.

This does not currently support Unicode-encoded files.
