=head1 NAME

Text::Fuzzy - Partial string matching using edit distances

=head1 SYNOPSIS

[% INCLUDE "/home/ben/projects/Text-Fuzzy/examples/synopsis.pl" | xtidy %]

=head1 VERSION

This documents version [% info.version %] of Text::Fuzzy corresponding
to git commit L<[% commit.commit %]|[% info.repo %]/commit/[%
commit.commit %]> released on [% commit.date %].

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module calculates edit distances between words, and searches
arrays and files to find the nearest entry by edit distance. It
handles both byte strings and character strings (strings containing
Unicode), treating each Unicode character as a single entity.

[% INCLUDE "/home/ben/projects/Text-Fuzzy/examples/unicode.pl" | xtidy %]

The default edit distance is the Levenshtein one, which counts each
addition (C<cat> -> C<cart>), substitution (C<cat> -> C<cut>), and
deletion (C<carp> -> C<cap>) as one unit. The Damerau-Levenshtein edit
distance, which also allows transpositions (C<salt> -> C<slat>) may
also be selected with the L</transpositions_ok> method or the
L</trans> option.

This module is particularly suited to searching for the nearest match
to a term over a list of words, using the L</nearestv> or L</nearest>
methods.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    my $tf = Text::Fuzzy->new ('bibbety bobbety boo');

Create a new Text::Fuzzy object from the supplied word.

The following parameters may be supplied to new:

=over

=item max

    my $tf = Text::Fuzzy->new ('Cinderella', max => 3);

This option affects the behaviour of L</nearestv> and L</nearest>
methods. When searching over an array, this sets the maximum edit
distance allowed for a word to be considered a "near match". For
example, with

    my $tf = Text::Fuzzy->new ('Cinderella');
    $tf->set_max_distance (3);

when using L</nearest>, 'Cinder' will not be considered a match, but
'derella' will.

To switch off the maximum distance, and allow all words to be
considered, you can set C<max> to be a negative value:

    my $tf = Text::Fuzzy->new ('Cinderella', max => -1);

Note that this is the default, so there is hardly any point specifying
it, except if you want to make self-documenting code, or you're
worried that the module's default behaviour may suddenly change.

Setting C<max> to zero makes C<$tf> only match exactly, which is also
pointless, but you're very welcome to do it.

The method L</set_max_distance> also does the same thing as this
parameter.

=item no_exact

    my $tf = Text::Fuzzy->new ('slipper', no_exact => 1);

This parameter switches on rejection of exact matches, in the same way
as the method L</no_exact>:

    my $tf = Text::Fuzzy->new ('slipper');
    $tf->no_exact (1);

This is useful for the case of scanning an array which contains the
search term itself, when we are interested in near matches only. For
example, if we have a dictionary of words and we need to find near
matches for a word which is in the dictionary.

=item trans

    my $tf = Text::Fuzzy->new ('glass', trans => 1);

This switches on transpositions, in other words it uses the
Damerau-Levenshtein edit distance rather than the Levenshtein edit
distance. The method L</transpositions_ok> has the same effect as
this.

=back

=head2 distance

    my $dist = $tf->distance ($word);

This method's return value is the edit distance to C<$word> from the
word used to create the object in L</new>.

[% INCLUDE "/home/ben/projects/Text-Fuzzy/examples/distance.pl" | xtidy %]

To know which edits are used to convert the words, use
L</distance_edits>.

=head2 nearestv

    my $nearest_word = $tf->nearestv (\@words);
    my @nearest_words = $tf->nearestv (\@words);

Returns the value in C<@words> which has the nearest distance to the
value given to C<$tf> in L</new>. In array context, it returns a list
of the nearest values.

[% INCLUDE "/home/ben/projects/Text-Fuzzy/examples/nearestv.pl" | xtidy %]

The behaviour of the match can be controlled with L</no_exact> and
L</set_max_distance> in exactly the same way as L</nearest>.

This is a convenient wrapper around the L</nearest>
function. L</nearest> is annoying to use, because it only returns
array offsets, and also error-prone due to having to check to
distinguish the first element of the array from an undefined value
using C<defined>.

This method was added in version 0.18 of Text::Fuzzy.

=head2 nearest

    my $index = $tf->nearest (\@words);
    my $nearest_word = $words[$index];

Given an array reference, this returns a number, the index of the
nearest element in the array C<@words> to the argument to
L</new>. Having found the nearest match you then need to look up the
value in the array, as in C<$nearest_word> above.

It is possible to set a maximum edit distance, beyond which entries
are rejected, using L</set_max_distance> or the C<max> parameter to
L</new>.  In this case, if none of the elements of C<@words> are less
than the maximum distance away from the word, C<$index> is the
undefined value, so when setting a maximum distance, it is necessary
to check the return value of index using C<defined>.

[% INCLUDE "/home/ben/projects/Text-Fuzzy/examples/check-return.pl" | xtidy %]

If there is more than one word with the same edit distance in
C<@words>, this returns the last one found, unless it is an exact
match, in which case it returns the first one found. To get all
matches, call it in array context:

    my @nearest = $tf->nearest (\@words);

In array context, if there are no matches within the minimum distance,
C<nearest> returns an empty list. If there is one or more match, it
returns the array offset of it or them, not the value itself.

[% INCLUDE "/home/ben/projects/Text-Fuzzy/examples/list-context.pl" | xtidy %]

=head2 last_distance

    my $last_distance = $tf->last_distance ();

The distance from the previous match's closest match. This is used in
conjunction with L</nearest> or L</nearestv> to find the edit distance
to the previous match.

[% INCLUDE "/home/ben/projects/Text-Fuzzy/examples/last-distance.pl" | xtidy %]

=head2 set_max_distance

    # Set the max distance.
    $tf->set_max_distance (3);

Set the maximum edit distance of C<$tf>. Set the maximum distance to a
low value to improve the speed of searches over lists with
L</nearest>, or to reject unlikely matches. When searching for a near
match, anything with an edit distance of a value over the maximum is
rejected without computing the exact distance. To compute exact
distances, call this method without an argument:

    $tf->set_max_distance ();

The maximum edit distance is switched off, and whatever the nearest
match is is accepted. A negative value also switches it off:

    $tf->set_max_distance (-1);

The object created by L</new> has no maximum distance unless specified
by the user.

[% INCLUDE "/home/ben/projects/Text-Fuzzy/examples/max-dist.pl" | xtidy %]

Setting the maximum distance is a way to make a search more rapid. For
example if you are searching over a dictionary of 100,000 or a million
words, and only need close matches, you can more rapidly reject
unwanted matches by setting the maximum distance to a lower
value. Calculating Levenshtein distance is an O(n^2) algorithm in the
lengths of the words, so even a small increase in the maximum
permitted distance means a much larger amount of work for the computer
to do. With the maximum distance set, the computer can give up
calculating more quickly with bad matches.

=head2 transpositions_ok

    $tf->transpositions_ok (1);

A true value in the argument changes the type of edit distance used to
allow transpositions, such as C<clam> and C<calm>. Initially
transpositions are not allowed, giving the Levenshtein edit
distance. If transpositions are used, the edit distance becomes the
Damerau-Levenshtein edit distance. A false value disallows
transpositions:

    $tf->transpositions_ok (0);

=head2 no_exact

    $tf->no_exact (1);

This is a flag to L</nearest> which makes it ignore exact matches. For
example,

[% INCLUDE "/home/ben/projects/Text-Fuzzy/examples/no-exact.pl" | xtidy %]

This prints

[% INCLUDE "/home/ben/projects/Text-Fuzzy/examples/no-exact-out.txt" | xtidy %]

This is for the case of searching over an array which contains the
searched-for item itself.

=head2 scan_file

    my $nearest = $tf->scan_file ('/usr/share/dict/words');

Scan a file to find the nearest match to the word used in
L</new>. This assumes that the file contains lines of text separated
by newlines, and finds the closest match in the file. Its return value
is a string rather than a line number. It cannot return an array of
values. It does not currently support Unicode-encoded files.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

These functions do not require a C<Text::Fuzzy> object.

=head2 distance_edits

    my ($distance, $edits) = distance_edits ('before', 'after');

This returns the edit distance between the two arguments, and the
edits necessary to transform the first one into the second
one. C<$Edits> is a string containing the four letters I<k>, I<r>,
I<d>, and I<i>, for "keep", "replace", "delete", and "insert"
respectively. For example, for "piece" and "peace", C<$edits> contains
"krrkk" for "keep, replace, replace, keep, keep".

[% INCLUDE "/home/ben/projects/Text-Fuzzy/examples/distance-edits.pl" | xtidy %]

This does not handle transpositions. Unlike the rest of the module,
this is pure Perl rather than XS, and not optimized for speed. The
edit distance search within L</nearest> is optimized for speed, and
hence discards its record of edits used to get the result.

=head2 fuzzy_index

    my ($offset, $edits, $distance) = fuzzy_index ($needle, $haystack);

Searches for SUBSTR in STR using fuzzy matching.

Return value is the offest of the closest match found, the edits
necessary on C<$needle> to make it into the matching text, and the
Levenshtein edit distance between the matching part of C<$haystack>
and C<$needle>.

For the algorithm used, see

L<http://ginstrom.com/scribbles/2007/12/01/fuzzy-substring-matching-with-levenshtein-distance-in-python/>

This is implemented in Perl not C, and it's slow due to lots of
debugging code. Please expect the interface and internals to change.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 misspelt-web-page.cgi

The file F<examples/misspelt-web-page.cgi> is an example of a CGI
script which does something similar to the Apache mod_speling module,
offering spelling corrections for mistyped URLs and sending the user
to a correct page.

[% INCLUDE "/home/ben/projects/Text-Fuzzy/examples/misspelt-web-page.cgi" | xtidy %]

See also L<http://www.lemoda.net/perl/perl-mod-speling/> for how to
set up F<.htaccess> to use the script.

=head2 spell-check.pl

The file F<examples/spell-check.pl> is a spell checker. It uses a
dictionary of words specified by a command-line option "-d":

    spell-check.pl -d /usr/dict/words file1.txt file2.txt

It prints out any words which look like spelling mistakes, using the
dictionary.

[% INCLUDE "/home/ben/projects/Text-Fuzzy/examples/spell-check.pl" | xtidy %]

Because the usual Unix dictionary doesn't have plurals, it uses
L<Lingua::EN::PluralToSingular>, to convert nouns into singular
forms. Unfortunately it still misses past participles and past tenses
of verbs.

=head2 extract-kana.pl

The file F<examples/extract-kana.pl> extracts the kana entries from
"edict", a freely-available Japanese to English electronic dictionary,
and does some fuzzy searches on them. It requires a local copy of the
file to run. This script demonstrates the use of Unicode searches with
Text::Fuzzy.

=head1 PRIVATE METHODS

You probably do not need any of these methods. They are for
benchmarking the module and checking its correctness.

=head2 no_alphabet

    $tf->no_alphabet (1);

This turns off alphabetizing of the string. Alphabetizing is a filter
where the intersection of all the characters in the two strings is
computed, and if the alphabetical difference of the two strings is
greater than the maximum distance, the match is rejected without
applying the dynamic programming algorithm. This increases speed,
because the dynamic programming algorithm is slow.

The alphabetizing should not ever reject anything which is a
legitimate match, and it should make the program run faster in almost
every case. The only envisaged uses of switching this off are checking
that the algorithm is working correctly, and benchmarking performance.

=head2 get_trans

    my $trans_ok = $tf->get_trans ();

This returns the value set by L</transpositions_ok>.

=head2 unicode_length

    my $length = $tf->unicode_length ();

This returns the length in characters (not bytes) of the string used
in L</new>. If the string is not marked as Unicode, it returns the
undefined value. In the following, C<$l1> should be equal to C<$l2>.

    use utf8;
    my $word = 'ⅅⅆⅇⅈⅉ';
    my $l1 = length $word;
    my $tf = Text::Fuzzy->new ($word);
    my $l2 = $tf->unicode_length ();

=head2 ualphabet_rejections

    my $rejected = $tf->ualphabet_rejections ();

After running L</nearest> over an array, this returns the number of
entries of the array which were rejected using only the Unicode
alphabet. Its value is reset to zero each time L</nearest> is called.

=head2 alphabet_rejections

    my $rejected = $tf->alphabet_rejections ();

After running L</nearest> over an array, this returns the number of
entries of the array which were rejected using only the non-Unicode
alphabet. Its value is reset to zero each time L</nearest> is called.

=head2 length_rejections

    my $rejected = $tf->length_rejections ();

After running L</nearest> over an array, this returns the number of
entries of the array which were rejected because the length difference
between them and the target string was larger than the maximum
distance allowed.

=head2 get_max_distance

    # Get the maximum edit distance.
    print "The max distance is ", $tf->get_max_distance (), "\n";

Get the maximum edit distance of C<$tf>. The maximum distance may be
set with L</set_max_distance>.
